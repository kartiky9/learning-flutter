### Layouts
Flutter's Layout System is heavily inspired from webs FlexBox

#### Row & Column
- Row or Column Widget used to organize children widgets
- Both Row and Column can be nested in each other
- Alignment is controlled along axis with `mainAxisAlignment` (center, spaceAround, spaceEvenly) and `crossAxisAlignment` (start, end, strech). 
- Widgets used inside can be wrapped with layout widgets like [`Expanded`](#Expanded) or [`Flexible`](#Flexible) to adjust flex proportions and also adjust responsively with increase in number of elements, example, when elements gets added programatically in the row/column)
